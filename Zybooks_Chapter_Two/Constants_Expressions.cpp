/*
The cost to ship a package is a flat fee of 75 cents plus 25 cents per pound.
1. Declare a const named CENTS_PER_POUND and initialize with 25.
2. Get the shipping weight from user input storing the weight into shipWeightPounds.
3. Using FLAT_FEE_CENTS and CENTS_PER_POUND constants, assign shipCostCents with the cost of shipping a package weighing shipWeightPounds.
