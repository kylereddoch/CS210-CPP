These are the scripts that I created while in my C++ class (CS-210) at SNHU.

All Labs are from the zyBooks program. The Class Assignments and Projects are what is turned in via the online learning systems. The Projects will be linked to the appropriate repository.

**Lab 2.25**

Write a program with a car's miles/gallon and gas dollars/gallon (both doubles) as input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing ``cout << fixed << setprecision(2);`` once before all other cout statements.
