These are the scripts that I created while in my C++ class (CS-210) at SNHU.

All Activites and Labs are from the zyBooks program. The Class Assignments and Projects are what is turned in via the online learning systems. The Projects will be linked to the appropriate repository.

**If you have found these to be helpful, please consider sponsoring my work or donating.**

### Project One

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input for adding hours and minutes using secure and efficient C++ code.
